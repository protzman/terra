// // ! TODO : on selection of operation change placeholder to {`hillshade ${faker.random.uuid()} } or something
// TODO : maybe move draw thingy into own component with variable inputs for the type selected
// // ! TODO : what is the radius for in the HLZ advanced options if the shape i already drawn (move to options)
// // ! TODO : similar to above, viewshed only has option for point, but then has a radius slider, is this just not a roundabout way of doing a circle
// TODO : clear active draw feature when switching between operations
// TODO : dashes / pluses typed in inputs within the application zoom out / in on the map

// // ! TODO : HLZ has radius slider regardless of shape (not needed even for sphere unless you're going to allow point (kinda makes sense))
// TODO : |> radius slider would be stupid anyways with sphere since you cannot update a shape via a slider

// TODO : maybe add a second vector layer only to hold radius LineString objects

// * why need hlz_radius for HLZ submission if you dont even support point radius and have selected bounding box
// TODO : fix the padding on the BoundingBoxInputs causing side scroll on the two side by side inputs (same for CircleInputs for area / radius)

// TODO : change viewshed layer styles to camel case / bbox/ point non required

// TODO : convert the AppMenu component to be spawned / behave like the two menus on the bottom

// TODO : import typescript models from desktop and begin rework

// TODO : re-enable the circle choice in Options.js. re-enable viewshed / implement aspect
